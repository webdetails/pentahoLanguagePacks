# Context Help Message Bundle for PIR
#
# How to describe a help topic:
# The key of property should match the div target in the document you want to
# associate help content with.
# {key}_content = Rich text content for a simple tooltip
# {key}_ref = Relative path to help document to embed in popup (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
#
# Note: _content and _ref are mutually exclusive. Either provide a relative path
# reference to the document to load for the help content or provide a simple tooltip.
#
# Optional properties:
# If the div id is not a legal identifier string you may provide a _target suffix and specify it there:
# {key}_target = id of element a help context is related to#
#
# {key}_position = Help popup will be placed at the first available position: {before, after, above, below}
#     (see dijit.Tooltip#position doc: http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/Tooltip.html)
